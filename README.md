# Heart Disease Risk Prediction: Logistic Regression Homework
## Introductory Context
Heart disease is the world's leading cause of death, claiming approximately 18 million lives each year, as reported by the World Health Organization. Predictive models like logistic regression can enable early identification of at-risk patients by analyzing clinical features such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. This not only improves treatment outcomes but also optimizes resource allocation in healthcare settings.

## Brief Data Analysis 
The Heart Disease Dataset is a well-known benchmark for binary classification in healthcare. It originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 303 patient records collected from clinical examinations.
This dataset includes 14 attributes (13 features + target), combining both continuous and categorical variables that capture demographic, clinical, and diagnostic information.
### Key Characteristics
- Instances: 303 patients
- Features: 13 clinical and demographic attributes
- Target: Binary indicator of heart disease presence

No missing values reported in the standard CSV version used for ML tasks, though some attributes like ca and thal may require careful handling if missing entries appear in other versions.
